title: Checking data integrity
---

The `mkbrr check` command verifies if the local files or directory match the data defined in a `.torrent` file. This is useful for confirming the integrity of downloaded content or checking files after moving them.

```bash
mkbrr check <torrent-file> <content-path> [flags]
```

## Arguments

-   `<torrent-file>`: (Required) The path to the `.torrent` file containing the expected piece hashes.
-   `<content-path>`: (Required) The path to the local file or directory containing the data to be checked.
    <Info>
      Ensure the `<content-path>` points directly to the file if the torrent contains a single file, or to the containing directory if the torrent contains multiple files or a folder structure.
    </Info>

## Flags

<ParamField path="--verbose, -v" type="boolean" default="false">
  Show the indices of any pieces that failed the hash check (bad pieces).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--quiet" type="boolean" default="false">
  Reduced output mode. Only prints the final completion percentage (e.g., `100.00%`). Useful for scripting.
</ParamField>

## Output

By default, the command provides a summary including:

-   **Completion:** Percentage of pieces successfully verified against the local data.
-   **Good pieces:** Number of pieces that match the hash in the torrent file.
-   **Bad pieces:** Number of pieces where the local data hash does not match the torrent file.
-   **Missing files:** Lists any files specified in the torrent that are missing locally. Files that exist but have an incorrect size will be listed with ` (size mismatch)` appended to their name.
-   **Check time:** Duration of the verification process.

If `--verbose` is used, the indices of bad pieces are also listed.
If `--quiet` is used, only the completion percentage is printed.

The command exits with an error code if verification fails (bad pieces > 0 or missing files > 0).

## Examples

**Check a downloaded directory against its torrent file:**
```bash
mkbrr check MyShow.S01.torrent /path/to/downloads/MyShow.S01/
```

**Check a single file:**
```bash
mkbrr check MyMovie.mkv.torrent /path/to/downloads/MyMovie.mkv
```

**Check verbosely to see bad piece indices:**
```bash
mkbrr check data.zip.torrent /data/files/data.zip -v
```

**Check in quiet mode for scripting:**
```bash
mkbrr check archive.rar.torrent /backups/archive.rar --quiet
# Output might be: 99.50%
