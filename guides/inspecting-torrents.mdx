# Inspecting Torrents

The `mkbrr inspect` command allows you to view the metadata and file structure contained within a `.torrent` file without needing the actual content files.

```bash
mkbrr inspect <torrent-file> [flags]
```

## Arguments

-   `<torrent-file>`: (Required) The path to the `.torrent` file you want to inspect.

## Flags

<ParamField path="--verbose, -v" type="boolean" default="false">
  Show all metadata fields found in the torrent file, including non-standard ones in both the root and info dictionaries.
</ParamField>

## Output

The command displays the following information by default:

-   **Name:** The root name of the torrent content.
-   **Hash:** The info hash of the torrent.
-   **Size:** Total size of the content.
-   **Piece length:** Size of each piece.
-   **Pieces:** Total number of pieces.
-   **Trackers:** Announce URLs.
-   **Web seeds:** Any web seed URLs included.
-   **Private:** Whether the private flag is set.
-   **Source:** The source tag, if present.
-   **Comment:** The comment, if present.
-   **Created by:** The tool used to create the torrent, if specified.
-   **Created on:** The creation date, if specified.
-   **Files:** Number of files (for multi-file torrents).

If the torrent contains multiple files, a file tree is also displayed, showing the path and size of each file within the torrent structure.

## Examples

**Inspect a torrent file:**
```bash
mkbrr inspect my-release.torrent
```

**Inspect a torrent file with verbose output to see all metadata:**
```bash
mkbrr inspect another.torrent -v
