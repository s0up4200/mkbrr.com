---

## Prerequisites

- **Go:** Version 1.23 or higher (as specified in `go.mod`).
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **Make:** For using the provided build and test commands.

## Building from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/autobrr/mkbrr.git
    cd mkbrr
    ```

2.  **Build the binary:**
    This command compiles the `mkbrr` binary into the `build/` directory.
    ```bash
    make build
    ```
    *Optional: Build with Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) after generating a profile (see `Makefile` for `make profile` details):*
    ```bash
    make build-pgo
    ```


3.  **Install the binary:**
    This command installs the built binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory or `/usr/local/bin` if run as root. Ensure the target directory is in your system's `PATH`.
    ```bash
    # Install to $GOPATH/bin
    make install

    # Or install system-wide (requires sudo)
    sudo make install
    ```

## Running Tests

The `Makefile` provides several targets for running tests:

-   **Run standard tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

-   **Run tests with race detection:**
    ```bash
    make test-race
    ```
    *(Note: Race reports, if any, are saved to `race_report.log`)*

-   **Run large tests (resource intensive, requires `-tags=large_tests`):**
    ```bash
    make test-large
    ```

-   **Run tests with coverage:**
    Generates `coverage.txt` and `coverage.html`.
    ```bash
    make test-coverage
    ```

## Linting

Check the code for style issues and potential errors using `golangci-lint`:

```bash
make lint
```
*(This will automatically install `golangci-lint` if it's not found.)*

## Cleaning

Remove build artifacts and generated files:

```bash
make clean
```

## License

`mkbrr` is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v2.0**. You can find the full license text in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/autobrr/mkbrr/blob/main/LICENSE) file in the repository.
