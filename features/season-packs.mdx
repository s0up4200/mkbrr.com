<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Video Files" icon="film">
    Only analyzes files with these extensions:
    - `.mkv`
    - `.mp4`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Episode Patterns" icon="list-ol">
    Detects episode numbers from:
    - Single: `S01E01`
    - Range: `S01E01-E03`
    - Multi: `S01E01E02`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Season Detection Patterns" icon="magnifying-glass">
    mkbrr looks for season numbers in directory and file names using these patterns:

    ```plaintext
    Show.S01.Complete
    Show.Season.01
    Show.S01
    [S01]
    /Season 01/
    /S01/
    Show.S01.1080p
    Season 01/
    ```

    <Info>
    Season detection is case-insensitive and handles various separators (dots, dashes, underscores, spaces).

  <Accordion title="How Completeness Check Works" icon="check">
    mkbrr determines if a season pack is suspicious by:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Find Highest Episode">
        Scan all video files to determine the highest episode number in the pack
      </Step>
      <Step title="Count Episodes">
        Count unique episodes found across all valid video files
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check for Gaps">
        Compare episode numbers to identify any missing episodes in the sequence
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
    The detection focuses on standard episode numbering. Special episodes (S01E00) and unconventional naming may affect accuracy.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example Warning Output" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    ```plaintext
    Warning: Possible incomplete season pack detected
      Season number: 1
      Highest episode number found: 4
      Episodes found: 3
      Missing: episode 3

    This may be an incomplete season pack. Check files before uploading.
    ```

<Note>
This feature helps catch common packaging mistakes but isn't foolproof. Always verify your files manually before uploading to trackers.
