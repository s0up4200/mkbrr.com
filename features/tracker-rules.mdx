title: Tracker rules
description: mkbrr includes built-in knowledge about the specific requirements of various private trackers to help ensure the torrents you create are compliant. When you provide a tracker URL (`-t` flag or via presets/batch), `mkbrr` checks if it matches a known tracker and applies relevant rules automatically.

## How it Works

When creating a torrent, `mkbrr` compares the provided tracker URL against an internal list of configurations. If a match is found, it applies the corresponding rules regarding:

1.  **Maximum Piece Length:** Enforces an upper limit on the piece size (e.g., 16 MiB, 8 MiB). If automatic calculation or a manually specified piece length (`-l`, `-m`) exceeds this limit, `mkbrr` caps it at the tracker's maximum.
2.  **Recommended Piece Size Ranges:** Selects a specific piece size based on the total content size, overriding the default automatic calculation (e.g., use 1 MiB pieces for content between 1-2 GB). If verbose mode (`-v`) is enabled, `mkbrr` will indicate when it's using a tracker-specific range.
3.  **Maximum `.torrent` File Size:** If the generated `.torrent` file would exceed a tracker's limit (e.g., 250 KiB for Anthelion), `mkbrr` automatically attempts to increase the piece length (up to a practical maximum of 16 MiB / 2^24) to reduce the number of piece hashes and thus the overall file size. If the limit still cannot be met, creation will fail.

<Warning>
Note that tracker-specific rules for maximum piece length or piece size ranges will override values set manually using the `-l` or `-m` flags if the manual values conflict with the tracker's requirements. `mkbrr` prioritizes tracker compliance.
</Warning>

## Handled Rules Summary

Here's a summary of the rules `mkbrr` currently handles based on its internal configuration:

*   **Max Piece Length:**
    *   **64 MiB (2^26):** GGN
    *   **16 MiB (2^24):** HDB, BHD, PTP, SBS, TS, BTN, NB
    *   **8 MiB (2^23):** EMP, MTV
*   **Piece Size Ranges:** Specific ranges based on content size are used for trackers like PTP, GGN, NB, BTN, TS. (See source code below for details).
*   **Max Torrent Size:**
    *   **250 KiB:** ANT
    *   **1 MiB:** GGN

## Configuration Source (`internal/trackers/trackers.go`)

The specific rules and tracker URLs are defined within the `mkbrr` source code in the `trackerConfigs` variable. You can view the exact configuration below or directly in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/autobrr/mkbrr/blob/main/internal/trackers/trackers.go).

This configuration is subject to change as tracker rules evolve. Contributions to keep this list accurate are welcome via pull requests to the `mkbrr` repository.
