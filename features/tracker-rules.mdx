title: Tracker rules
description: mkbrr includes built-in knowledge about the specific requirements of various private trackers to help ensure the torrents you create are compliant. When you provide a tracker URL (`-t` flag or via presets/batch), `mkbrr` checks if it matches a known tracker and applies relevant rules automatically.

<Note>
mkbrr automatically detects tracker requirements based on the announce URL and applies the appropriate rules to ensure your torrents are compliant.
</Note>

## How it Works

When creating a torrent, `mkbrr` compares the provided tracker URL against an internal list of configurations. If a match is found, it applies the corresponding rules:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Piece Length" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Enforces maximum piece size limits specific to each tracker (e.g., 16 MiB, 8 MiB).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Size Ranges" icon="ruler">
    Selects optimal piece sizes based on content size using tracker-specific guidelines.
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Size" icon="file">
    Ensures the .torrent file stays within tracker size limits by adjusting piece length.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Tracker-specific rules override manual settings (`-l` or `-m` flags) to ensure compliance. mkbrr always prioritizes tracker requirements.
</Warning>

## Implemented Trackers

Below is a list of implemented trackers and their specific requirements:

<Info>
The tracker rules are maintained in the [mkbrr source code](https://github.com/autobrr/mkbrr/blob/main/internal/trackers/trackers.go). Contributions to keep rules updated are welcome via pull requests.
