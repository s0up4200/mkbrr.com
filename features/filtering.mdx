title: Filtering
description: Excluding and including files.
---

When creating a torrent from a directory, you can control which files are included using the `--include` and `--exclude` flags with the `mkbrr create` command. These flags accept [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) to match filenames.

## Built-in Exclusions

`mkbrr` always excludes the following common system and temporary files (case-insensitive):

-   `.torrent`
-   `.ds_store`
-   `thumbs.db`
-   `desktop.ini`
-   `zone.identifier`

## `--exclude` Flag

Use `--exclude` to specify patterns for files you want to *prevent* from being included in the torrent.

-   You can use the flag multiple times: `--exclude "*.nfo" --exclude "*sample*"`
-   You can provide a comma-separated list: `--exclude "*.nfo,*sample*,*.txt"`
-   Patterns are matched against the filename only (not the full path).
-   Matching is case-insensitive.

**Example:** Exclude all `.nfo` files and any file containing `sample`.
```bash
mkbrr create /path/to/release/ -t ... --exclude "*.nfo,*sample*"
```

## `--include` Flag

Use `--include` to specify patterns for files that *must* be included.
<Warning>
Using `--include` activates a strict whitelist. Only files matching these patterns are considered for inclusion; all other files (except those matching built-in exclusions) are ignored immediately.
</Warning>

-   You can use the flag multiple times: `--include "*.mkv" --include "*.mp4"`
-   You can provide a comma-separated list: `--include "*.mkv,*.mp4,*.avi"`
-   Patterns are matched against the filename only.
-   Matching is case-insensitive.

**Example:** Include only `.mkv` and `.mp4` video files.
```bash
mkbrr create /path/to/release/ -t ... --include "*.mkv,*.mp4"
```

## Precedence Rules

The filtering logic follows these steps:

1.  **Built-in Exclusions:** Files matching `.torrent`, `.ds_store`, etc., are always ignored first.
2.  **`--include` Check:** If `--include` patterns are provided:
    *   Does the filename match any `--include` pattern?
        *   **Yes:** Keep the file. Proceed no further for this file.
        *   **No:** Ignore the file. Proceed no further for this file.
3.  **`--exclude` Check:** If *no* `--include` patterns were provided:
    *   Does the filename match any `--exclude` pattern?
        *   **Yes:** Ignore the file.
        *   **No:** Keep the file.
4.  **Default:** If none of the above rules cause the file to be ignored, it is kept.

<Info>
In essence, `--include` acts as a whitelist when used. If you only want specific file types, use `--include`. If you want most files but need to skip a few specific types, use `--exclude`.

## Usage in Presets and Batch Mode

Both `exclude_patterns` and `include_patterns` can also be defined within your `presets.yaml` or `batch.yaml` files, following the same glob pattern rules and precedence logic. Command-line flags (`--exclude`, `--include`) will append to any patterns defined in a used preset.
