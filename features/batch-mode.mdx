# Batch Mode

Batch mode allows you to create multiple torrents from different source paths with varying settings in a single command execution.

## Configuration File (`batch.yaml`)

Batch operations are defined in a YAML file, typically named `batch.yaml`. You specify this file using the `-b` (or `--batch`) flag with the `create` command.

```bash
mkbrr create -b batch.yaml
```

### Structure

The `batch.yaml` file defines a list of jobs:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autobrr/mkbrr/main/schema/batch.json
version: 1
jobs:
  # Job 1: Create a torrent for a single file
  - output: /path/to/output/movie.torrent # Output .torrent file path
    path: /path/to/source/movie.mkv       # Source file path
    trackers:
      - https://tracker-one.com/announce/abc
    private: true
    comment: "My Movie"
    source: "Source1"

  # Job 2: Create a torrent for a directory
  - output: /path/to/output/album.torrent
    path: /path/to/source/album-directory/
    trackers:
      - udp://tracker-two.org:6969/announce
    private: false # Public torrent
    piece_length: 18 # 256 KiB pieces
    webseeds:
      - http://seed.example.com/album/
    exclude_patterns:
      - "*.log"
      - "cover.jpg"

  # Add more jobs as needed...
```

-   **`version`**: Must be `1`.
-   **`jobs`**: A list of individual torrent creation tasks. Each job requires:
    -   `output`: The full path where the resulting `.torrent` file should be saved.
    -   `path`: The full path to the source file or directory for this job.
-   **Optional Job Settings**: Each job can also include any of the following options, which correspond to the flags available in the standard `mkbrr create` command:
    -   `trackers`: List of announce URLs.
    -   `webseeds`: List of web seed URLs.
    -   `private`: `true` or `false`.
    -   `piece_length`: Piece size exponent (e.g., `18` for 256 KiB).
    -   `comment`: Torrent comment string.
    -   `source`: Source tag string.
    -   `no_date`: `true` to omit creation date.
    -   `exclude_patterns`: List of glob patterns to exclude files within this job's source path.
    -   `include_patterns`: List of glob patterns to include files within this job's source path.

You can find the formal JSON schema for validation [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autobrr/mkbrr/main/schema/batch.json).

## Execution

When you run `mkbrr create -b <your-config.yaml>`, `mkbrr` will:

1.  Validate the configuration file.
2.  Process the jobs concurrently (up to 4 jobs at a time by default) for efficiency.
3.  Create the specified `.torrent` files at their respective `output` paths.
4.  Display a summary of successful and failed jobs, along with total size and processing time. If run with `-v` (verbose), it shows detailed results for each job.

<Note>
You cannot provide a source path argument directly to `mkbrr create` when using the `-b` flag. All source paths must be defined within the batch file jobs.
