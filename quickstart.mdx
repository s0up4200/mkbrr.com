## Creating Your First Torrent

Once installed, you can create torrents using the `mkbrr create` command.

### Private Torrent (Default)

Most private trackers require torrents to be marked as private. This is the default behavior.

```bash
mkbrr create path/to/your/content -t https://your-tracker.com/announce
```
This command creates a `.torrent` file (e.g., `your-tracker_content.torrent`) in the current directory.

### Public Torrent

For public trackers, use the `--private=false` flag.

```bash
mkbrr create path/to/your/content -t udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337/announce --private=false
```
This creates a public `.torrent` file.
