# Quick Start

Welcome to `mkbrr`! This guide will help you install the tool and create your first torrent file quickly.

## Installation

Choose the installation method that suits you best:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pre-built Binaries">
    Download the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture directly from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/autobrr/mkbrr/releases).

    Make sure the downloaded binary is executable and placed in a directory included in your system's `PATH`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Homebrew (macOS/Linux)">
    If you use Homebrew, you can install `mkbrr` with these commands:

    ```bash
    brew tap autobrr/mkbrr
    brew install mkbrr
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Go Install">
    If you have Go installed (version 1.23 or later recommended), you can install `mkbrr` using:

    ```bash
    go install github.com/autobrr/mkbrr@latest
    ```

    Ensure that your Go binary path (`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`) is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable.
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating Your First Torrent

Once installed, you can create torrents using the `mkbrr create` command.

### Private Torrent (Default)

Most private trackers require torrents to be marked as private. This is the default behavior.

```bash
# Replace path/to/your/content with the actual file or directory
# Replace https://your-tracker.com/announce with your tracker's URL
mkbrr create path/to/your/content -t https://your-tracker.com/announce
```
This command creates a `.torrent` file (e.g., `your-tracker_content.torrent`) in the current directory.

### Public Torrent

For public trackers, use the `--private=false` flag.

```bash
# Example using a public tracker
mkbrr create path/to/your/content -t udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337/announce --private=false
```
This creates a public `.torrent` file.
